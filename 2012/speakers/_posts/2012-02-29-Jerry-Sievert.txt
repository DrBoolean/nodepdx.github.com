This next presenter, a Portlander, is Jerry Sievert. Jerryâ€™s a good friend of mine, a connoisseur of awesome things (like beer, distilling, etc) and a bad ass Node-fu Master. Jerry has built the brick.js web framework and will be teaching us all a thing or three about this framework. Which as any self respecting coder would, Jerry has the brick.js code up on github.
