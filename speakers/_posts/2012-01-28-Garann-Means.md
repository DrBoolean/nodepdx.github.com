Garann is a JavaScript Dev in Austin with her dog and cat, who leap in for code reviews. She grew to love Node after a history of backend development combined with her passion for client-side apps. She has a, and I quote “colorful” blog, which I myself read every time she posts a new entry. She’s also an author of “Node for Front-End Developers” from O’Reilly, which she wrote when she wasn’t remodeling her house and coding awesome JavaScript magic!
