  </div>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>It is now one month away from the conference. Are you excited yet? </p>
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>They are on sale now for $50. They are going quickly, so <a href="http://nodepdx.eventbrite.com">get one while they last</a>. </p>
<h2>Dance Party</h2>
<p>Yup, that dance party we&#39;ve been talking about, totes happening on Thursday night. We&#39;ve booked an amazing local electro-pop band to open the night: Ask You In Gray. Turns out they also just released a new album. Go check it out on <a href="http://askyouingray.com"><a href="http://askyouingray.com">http://askyouingray.com</a></a>. </p>
<h2>CFP Is Over (or is it?)</h2>
<p>The CFP officially ended on April 8th, but then we had some great late submissions after the deadline. We&#39;re firm believers that rules are made to be broken, so please, if you&#39;re holding out on us and have this amazing talk you want to give, <a href="https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/tree/master/proposals">submit a proposal</a> soon, or the schedule will be full of OTHER awesome talks and it will be too late. We&#39;re rolling through the submissions now and contacting folks individually, so if you submitted a talk and we haven&#39;t gotten back to you yet, sit tight, you&#39;ll hear from us soon!</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<h4>Aron Racho</h4>
<p>The phrase &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; is a piece of jewelers&#39; jargon, referring to a step in preparing a gem for use in jewelry. It&#39;s also one of first films directed by the great Robert Zemeckis, who gave us such classics as Back To The Future, Forrest Gump, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. But we&#39;re not here to talk movies, or are we? Aron Racho, a talented guitar player and reformed Java developer, will tell us of his own journey to love JavaScript, which we will here-to-fore refer to using our own special jargon as &quot;Bromancing the Node&quot;. I&#39;m not completely sure what &quot;bromancing&quot; is, but Aron will be sharing that with us, straight from El Corazon.</p>
<h4>Christopher Meiklejohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/cmeik">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cmeiklejohn">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<pre><code>"Substitute damn every time you're inclined to write very; your editor will <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">delete</span> it <span class="keyword">and</span> the writing will be just <span class="keyword">as</span> it should be.<span class="string">" - Mark Twain</code></pre>
<p>Excellent quote. Christopher Meiklejohn is damn smart. Where&#39;s my editor? Apparently I don&#39;t have the &quot;damn.vim&quot; plugin loaded. Whatever. Christopher is a functional, but somewhat reactive (banana) programmer, who enjoys JavaScript and long walks through execution stacks on a mild summers eve. </p>
<h4>Max Ogden (<a href="https://twitter.com/maxogden">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maxogden">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>You probably know who Max is already... but did you know, that if Max&#39;s parents had chosen the name &quot;Mae&quot; instead, that Mae Ogden is an anagram for &quot;Node Game&quot;?? That would have been sweet because he&#39;s totally going to talk about Node and gaming. Ok, well, not really Node, specifically, Minecraft in the browser, in JavaScript (of course), and the nearly 100 modules that are part of this pretty nifty project called <a href="http://voxeljs.com/">voxel.js</a> that make it possible.</p>
<h4>Tracy Abrahms (<a href="https://twitter.com/HackyGoLucky">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hackygolucky">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Mario, or &quot;マリオ&quot; in Japanese, is one of my favourite 8-bit plumbers. Knowing no fear, Mario mercilessly punches rocks, gathers gold coins, and has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of surplus energy to use for running, jumping, and shimmying up and down large drain pipes. I don&#39;t know if Tracy is a plumber as well, but I do know, that like Mario, punching rocks is a favoured pastime. What does this have to do with JavaScript you ask? I&#39;ll let Tracy explain that in a month. Anticipation is the best thing ever. Or you could just <a href="https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/blob/master/proposals/punching-rocks_tracy-abrahms.md">read the PR</a>. </p>
<h4>Zach Babb (<a href="https://twitter.com/zkbabb">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zachbabb">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<pre><code>"Yo dawg, I heard you liked computers, so I put a computer <span class="flow">in</span> your computer so you could computer while you computer."</code></pre>
<p>This is a direct, verbatim quote from my favourite person-whose-last-name-is-the-name-of-a-cartoon-bunny, Zach Babb (ok, it was Babs, not Babb, but close, I say, and its a great mnemonic device). In all seriousness (it&#39;s opposite day), Zach is going to show us how to build a computer in your browser. Hmmm... Should this be on the hardware track or the software track; I&#39;M NOT COMPLETELY SURE.</p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<h4>Basho</h4>
<p><a href="http://basho.com">Basho</a> is my favourite group of Erlang nerds that make rhizomatic distributed software. Did you know that Riak means ripple in Indonesian (though more commonly used as a root meaning &quot;yell&quot;), and that ripple is just a common name for a capillary wave? So glad they didn&#39;t name the database &quot;Capillary Wave&quot;.</p>
<h4>Jive</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s clear some space and dance. What it is, Mama! Whether you&#39;re doing a lively six step, confusing an Airplane attendant with your unique dialectic, or just wanting a decent collaboration platform for your &quot;enterprise&quot; (do enterprises call themselves enterprises, or just businesses?), <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive Software</a> is the place to be, hep cat. They were also the first Portland company I heard of that had a beer tap in their office break room. Just sayin. </p>
<h4>Sticker Mule</h4>
<p>Stickers are some of the best things ever. Last year, we gave out &quot;Do Not Disturb, Noding in Progress&quot; stickers, which were quite nice. This year, <a href="http://stickermule.com">Sticker Mule</a> is providing all of our stickers for free. Shiny, captain.</p>
<h2>Just for fun</h2>
<p>What&#39;s your Garbage Pail Kid name? </p>
<p>Adron &lt;=&gt; Large Adron Collider
Troy &lt;=&gt; Destroy Troy
Luc &lt;=&gt; Luc Puke</p>

    <p class="post-date">march 27th 2013</p>
  </div>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hi everyone! Things are shaping up well and we have some more interesting tidbits to share with you.</p>
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Ok, Early Bird tickets are going on sale <em>on Monday</em>. We will send another email, tweet, and generally be really loud about that on Monday, but if you want you can set an alarm, get out your sleeping bag and tent, camp outside your laptop and wait: 9am on Monday morning is the time. </p>
<h2>Dance Party</h2>
<p>So we worked it out to have the venue to ourselves all night. So, what to do? Naturally, we&#39;re booking a couple amazing local DJs and having a dance party/hackathon. That&#39;s right, dance, hack, dance, hack, visit the photo-booth, dance some more. From 8pm until 2:30am the doors will be open for an open-access dance party and hackathon. Got a co-worker or BFF who can&#39;t make the main event? Invite them out for the evening festivities. It&#39;s going to be a blast! Dancing and hacking &#39;til dawn not your thing? (ok, you&#39;re weird) but don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll also be scheduling some additional peripheral events at near-by locations, for a quieter atmosphere. More on that later.</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>First, we&#39;re excited to announce the next round of speakers.</p>
<h4>Thorsten Lorenz (<a href="https://twitter.com/thl0">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Thorsten just can&#39;t be stopped. Don&#39;t know Thorsten? Well, you might have seen the sweet <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/replpad">replpad</a> project or enjoyed the ease of debugging that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/source-map">source map</a> support for <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a> has provided. You can thank Thorsten for that. Thorsten is going to school us on the &quot;how and why&quot; of writing small single-purpose JavaScript modules, something we think is super important.</p>
<h4>Eva Giselle (<a href="https://twitter.com/evagiselle">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/evagiselle">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>So, remember when Node wasn&#39;t around yet and client-side JavaScript was boring, and everyone was like &quot;Sigh, I have to go write some JavaScript for this stupid webpage, and I don&#39;t even like it or know how to do it right, if there even is such a thing as doing it right.&quot; Now we&#39;re all amazing JavaScript musketeers, swashbuckling our way through the browser leaving little curly-braces laying around everywhere, chests full of pride, victory pumping through our veins. That is, until you hit that little bump in the road... CSS. Just when you were having fun in the browser, CSS goes and reminds you that you don&#39;t know what the heck you&#39;re doing. Well, luckily for us, Eva Giselle is an amazing web designer, illustrator, motion-graphicker and holds a black-belt in the art of snark. In Eva&#39;s talk, we&#39;ll learn about that last undrained lagoon of sludgy uncertainty: CSS.</p>
<h4>Peter Braden (<a href="https://twitter.com/peterbraden">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/peterbraden">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Open your eyes, my little robot friend. What&#39;s that? Oh, nothing, just a flying drone with a camera on it and some wicked JavaScript code powering it. Peter Braden is going to enlighten you to the intricacies of putting a camera on a robot and processing those video streams to make decisions. Um, yeah, it&#39;s the future now.</p>
<h4>Adam Ulvi (<a href="https://twitter.com/s5fs">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aulvi">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>It&#39;s spring time, and if you&#39;re anything like me, you&#39;ve started weeding, tilling, and mixing manure into your soil, planting what will be the epic veggie crop of 2013. If you&#39;re also like me in totally another way, you&#39;ve got Nagios running somewhere emailing you whenever your server farm gets low on disk space or high on CPU. Wouldn&#39;t it be awesome to have that kind of insight into your vegetable garden? Adam Ulvi is going to show you how to &quot;put a sensor on it&quot; so that you can monitor your raspberries with your Raspberry. Ok, mostly it&#39;s lettuce. But you can see where I&#39;m going with this.</p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>Check out these great companies who are helping us to make this event happen.</p>
<h4>Urban Airship</h4>
<p>The hackers at <a href="http://urbanairship.com">Urban Airship</a> are some of the first people I ran into at the quintessential &quot;Cheers&quot;-of-Portland-Tech-scene, <a href="http://www.baileystaproom.com">Bailey&#39;s Taproom</a>. They&#39;ve got some of the brightest people in town building the best mobile push-notification system ever devised. Urban Airship has built a great product and an impressive company, basically starting from nothing (well nothing but a good idea and some righteous skills), and has stayed totally humble about it. In my mind, UA defines the Portland startup spirit as I know it. You might be thinking &quot;oh, but I thought they were a Python shop.&quot; Turns out you can love Python AND JavaScript at the SAME TIME. Whoa. Mind. Officially. Blown.</p>
<h4>New Relic</h4>
<p>We&#39;re really happy to welcome back another alumni sponsor, <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>. You may have gone to the after-party last year and enjoyed a beer on New Relic&#39;s dime. They are an awesome local company that continues to grow at an impressive rate. If you don&#39;t already have one, come to NodePDX if for no other reason than to get one of their rad t-shirts. Oh, and while you&#39;re at it, you just might want to try out their monitoring tools. Just maybe, cause you know, having metrics and deep insight into your application&#39;s performance is a good thing, &#39;mkay? And it&#39;s free. Duh.</p>
<h4>Janrain</h4>
<p><a href="http://janrain.com">Janrain</a> are a bunch of Haskell nerds... and Semantic Web nerds (and not too shabby at ping-pong). They are also parked literally right next to my favorite downtown coffee shop, <a href="http://baristapdx.com">Barista</a>. Need I say more? Ok, fine. Ever forgotten your password on a website and were totally relieved to see a &quot;Sign in with Facebook&quot; button? Well, Janrain didn&#39;t exactly invent OAuth, but they make that whole social-login user-management thing super easy and power like 99.9999% of all login pages (not an actual statistic). Try it!</p>
<h4>Devion (Payment Processing Partner)</h4>
<p>So, when you buy a ticket this year, you can thank <a href="http://devion.com">Devion</a>  for enabling our payment processing. You can also thank them after you go sign a contract with them to build your next website and find yourself amazed at how nice it turned out and how friendly their support is. We&#39;re still not completely sure how to pronounce their name though. Is it like &quot;DEV-EE-ON&quot; or &quot;DEE-VEE-ON&quot;? Hopefully they can straighten us out on that at in person. I encourage you to chat them up at the conference and find out the answer (and then come tell me).</p>

    <h1><a href="./2013-03-18-A-first-glimpse-at-NodePDX-2013.html">A first glimpse at NodePDX 2013</a></h1>
    <p class="post-date">march 18th 2013</p>
  </div>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hello fellow Nodistas, and welcome back to the party. NodePDX is coming back for another year. When we first got together a few months back, we were over-the-top excited, putting together details and hatching our initial plans. Now that we’ve begun booking speakers and nailing down some of the details, we’re more confident than ever that this is going to be a phenomenal conference. We just can&#39;t contain our excitement, so we&#39;ll be keeping all of you in the loop about what’s going on.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This year, NodePDX will be held at the lovely <a href="http://www.holocene.org/">Holocene</a> in Southeast PDX, on <a href="https://plus.google.com/118433524027456539719/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en">10th and SE Morrison</a>. Though Holocene is usually thought of as a music venue (and one of the best in town at that), it also turns out to be a wonderful place for a tech conference. It&#39;s spacious, aesthetically sleek, technologically well equipped, and located in the heart of the up-and-coming inner Southeast. And let&#39;s be honest: the fact that it&#39;s already a dance club doesn&#39;t hurt, now does it?</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<h4>Ward Cunningham (<a href="https://twitter.com/WardCunningham">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Let’s call a spade a spade: as the inventor of the wiki, Ward is one of the most important figures in the history of digital information exchange. But, not content to rest on figurative laurels, Ward continues to be very active in the Portland tech scene and remains a prolific innovator. Last year Ward shared with us a wonderful, Node/JavaScript-driven example of that; his <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki">The Smallest Federated Wiki</a>. This year, we&#39;ll see a deep dive, from solder to css, showing how data is surfaced from DIY sensors at Ward&#39;s home, then shared onto a federated wiki page via a custom DSL.</p>
<h4>Nexxy (<a href="https://twitter.com/nexxylove">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nexxy">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Nexxy, developer at <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/">Ninja Blocks</a> and future overlord of the Internet of Things, doesn’t so much &quot;give talks&quot; as provide wonderfully bizarre multimedia experiences, complete with robots, smoke machines, strobe lights, and house music, all tied together with heavy doses of JavaScript. Not only that, but Nexxy is helping organize our hardware track, so we&#39;re pretty sure your mind is going to be blown, one way or another, possibly two or three ways at the same time.</p>
<h4>Jerry Sievert (<a href="https://twitter.com/jerrysievert">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JerrySievert">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Jerry loves building things, and is the resident JavaScript guru at <a href="http://www.esri.com/">Esri</a>’s Portland R&amp;D Center (formerly <a href="https://geoloqi.com/">Geoloqi</a>). If you’ve been to <a href="http://www.baileystaproom.com/">Bailey’s Taproom</a> here in PDX, then you’ve seen Jerry’s handiwork without knowing it, as Jerry managed to string together the series of behind-the-scenes <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pis</a> that now power the Bailey’s digital interface. We&#39;ve seen Jerry chillin&#39; with an <a href="http://legitimatesounding.com/blog/Evented_Arduino_with_Node_js.html">Arduino</a> wired up to an Apple computing product with JavaScript code on the console. Awesome. Jerry and Nexxy are cohorting to organize the hardware track and just might teach you how to solder, if you ask nicely.</p>
<h4>Hannah Fouasnon (<a href="https://twitter.com/hanelifou">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fouasnon">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Hannah was a co-founder of <a href="http://luckysort.com/">LuckySort</a> and is currently the co-founder of and developer for <a href="http://djz.com/">DJZ</a>, an online resource for DJs and those who love them. Portland is still mourning the loss of our favorite former marine parasitology researcher to sunny San Francisco, so we&#39;re really excited Hannah is coming back for this. So, yeah, we&#39;ve got make sure NodePDX is the most Portlandy thing that Portland has ever Portlanded just to make Hannah jealous.</p>
<h4>Jason Denizac (<a href="https://twitter.com/leJDen">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jden">GitHub</a>)</h4>
<p>Jason is currently a JavaScript dev at <a href="http://www.agilediagnosis.com/">Agile Diagnosis</a> and is self-described as a health technologist. Another semi-Portlander living in the Bay Area, Jason is both a highly prolific contributor to the JavaScript community and a staunch proponent of working on things that matter. Some people talk the talk, but Jason walks the walk, evidenced via a sincere commitment to improving the state of technology in the health care industry.</p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<h4>Portland Incubator Experiment (PIE PDX)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.piepdx.com">PIE PDX</a> is a startup incubator in the fullest sense. Seriously, you just put little misshapen idea-eggs into this box over on NW Davis and 12th, and fully-formed and fully-funded startups pop out, all warm and fuzzy making weird little chirping noises. To the companies that are lucky enough to land a spot in one of PIE’s yearly Accelerator classes (thousands apply and only six make it), PIE offers far more than a friendly/funky shared office space and a kegerator: it offers graphic design resources, dedicated advisors, a wealth of camaraderie, and far more. Recent graduates of PIE include <a href="https://appthwack.com">AppThwack</a>, <a href="http://stublisher.com/">Stublisher</a>, <a href="http://lytics.io/">Lytics</a>, and others. We’re thrilled to have this crucial Portland institution as a sponsor.</p>
<h4>Silicon Florist (Media Sponsor)</h4>
<p>Want the inside scoop on what&#39;s happening in the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Forest">Silicon Forest</a>? Stop by our favorite not-really-a-flower-shop, <a href="http://www.siliconflorist.com">Silicon Florist</a>. Here you&#39;ll find only the best in independent Portland-focused tech news, guaranteed to be only as biased as <a href="http://twitter.com/turoczy">Rick Turoczy</a>&#39;s very well-informed opinion. We&#39;re super-grateful for their help spreading the word about NodePDX. So go read some stuff, check out the job board, and become one of the 1000 beautiful flowers that the Silicon Florist has helped to grow.</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>Well friends, that&#39;s all that we have to share at the moment, but stay tuned: we have lots more coming soon -- more speakers, more sponsors, more details. In fact, maybe you could be part of our next post? Our CFP is open now, so go ahead, <a href="http://nodepdx.org/#speakers">suggest a speaker</a> or <a href="http://nodepdx.org/#speakers">submit a talk</a>! </p>
<p>Does this look like the kind of thing your company would want to support? We have sponsorship opportunities available as well. Contact <a href="mailto:thoward37@gmail.com?Subject=[NodePDX]%20Sponsorship">Troy Howard</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Oh, and while I was standing in line for brunch the other day, an early little bird, happily munching on a worm, told me that tickets might be going on sale sometime next week, and they will be surprisingly cheep... I mean cheap (dang bird metaphors!).</p>
<p>Please come back and visit us here on <a href="http://nodepdx.org/#blog">the blog</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nodepdx">on Twitter</a> for more info as we go along!</p>
