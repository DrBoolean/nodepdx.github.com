NodePDX is an independent grassroots technology conference for the Portland Node.js and Javascript communities. The two-day conference will bring together local professionals from the Portland/Pacific Northwest area who are working with Node.js and Javascript to create highly-scalable, bleeding-edge internet/web-based applications.

This conference will be focused on technology and software development (as opposed to business/product development) and will draw an audience of extremely talented engineers who are passionate about pushing forward the latest and greatest advancements in web application development, cloud computing and a variety of related technologies.
