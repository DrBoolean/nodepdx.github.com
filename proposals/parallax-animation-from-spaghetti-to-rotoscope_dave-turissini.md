## Description

UI Engineering has always blended the line between development and design, and nowhere is this more evident with parallax effects. Although the basic premise of parallax is simple, listen to scroll events and move an element, it is all too often not approached in a way that meets our engineering sensibilities.
As with all of our code, we should strive to build functionality that is DRY, testable and bit size. Further, with parallax and animation in general, we need to have a strategy to implement complex animations from simplier ones.

How can we do this? Rotoscope is a very lightweight animation library designed to make parallax implementations light, DRY, flexible and testable. 
It supports and encourages timeline based animations so that you can compose very complex parallax from the simpliest of drawing. The performant update-draw render cycle at any given frame guarantees that performance will be maintained even as animations become more and more complex.

## Bio

Dave loves to animation things! He has been working with the web since the <font> tag was bleeding edge technology, and ever since then has strived to push the limits of what can be done in the browser. When not animation DOM nodes, Dave can probably be found in a coffee shop or out on the hiking trail.
